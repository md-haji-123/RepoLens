# RepoLens 🔍  
### AI-Powered GitHub Repository Evaluation & Developer Profiling Backend

This backend is built using **Flask** and is designed to **analyze GitHub repositories, evaluate code quality, and generate AI-driven insights for recruiters and developers**.

---

## 🧠 Complete Explanation of the RepoLens Backend (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Environment and Security Setup

The application starts by loading environment variables using `python-dotenv`. Sensitive credentials such as the **GitHub access token** and **Groq API key** are never hardcoded; they are securely loaded from the environment. The GitHub token helps avoid API rate limits, while the Groq key enables AI-powered analysis. If the Groq key is missing, the application fails early to prevent runtime issues, which follows production-level best practices.

### Step 2: Flask App Initialization and CORS

A Flask application is initialized as the backend server. **CORS is enabled** to allow requests from a frontend application, such as a React dashboard. This separation allows the frontend and backend to scale independently, which is a common industry architecture.

---

### Step 3: GitHub Repository Data Collection

When a user submits a GitHub repository URL, the backend first parses the URL to extract the repository owner and name. Using the **GitHub REST API**, it recursively walks through the repository structure, fetching all files and directories. This recursive traversal is required because GitHub exposes repository contents in a hierarchical format rather than a flat list.

For each file, the system detects whether:

- A README exists (documentation check)
- Test files exist (testing practices check)
- The programming language based on file extension

For Python files specifically, the backend downloads the source code and uses Python’s **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** module to safely analyze the code structure. This allows it to count functions and lines of code **without executing the code**, ensuring security and accuracy.

🔍 AST-Based Static Code Analysis (Core Logic)

For Python files, RepoLens uses Python’s built-in AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module to perform static code analysis.

Instead of executing the code, the backend parses each Python file into an AST using:

tree = ast.parse(code)


The AST represents the logical structure of the code, such as functions, variables, loops, and conditions, while ignoring formatting and comments. By walking through this tree using:

ast.walk(tree)


the system safely counts elements like:

Number of function definitions

Code structure complexity

This approach is secure, accurate, and execution-free, making it ideal for analyzing untrusted GitHub repositories. It also mirrors how professional tools like linters and compilers understand code internally.

---

### Step 4: Repository Metrics Generation

From the collected data, the backend computes key metrics such as:

- Total lines of code  
- Number of functions  
- Presence of documentation  
- Presence of tests  
- Commit count  
- Language distribution  

These metrics closely mirror **how recruiters and technical interviewers evaluate GitHub repositories**, making the analysis practically relevant.

---

### Step 5: Scoring and Evaluation Logic

The backend then converts raw metrics into meaningful scores. For example:

- Code quality is estimated using average function size  
- Documentation score depends on README presence  
- Testing score depends on test coverage  
- Git practices score depends on commit frequency  

Each category is weighted, and a **final readiness score** is calculated. This scoring system simulates a real-world hiring rubric rather than arbitrary numbers.

---

### Step 6: AI-Powered Insights Using Groq

Once metrics are calculated, they are passed to a **large language model via Groq**. The AI generates:

- A concise repository summary  
- Key strengths  
- Key weaknesses  

To ensure reliability, the backend enforces **strict JSON output** from the AI and safely extracts valid responses. This prevents malformed AI outputs from breaking the system.

---

### Step 7: Personalized Improvement Roadmap

In addition to evaluation, the backend generates a **step-by-step improvement roadmap** using AI. Based strictly on the repository’s metrics, it provides:

- Short-term actions (1–7 days)  
- Mid-term improvements (2–4 weeks)  
- Long-term growth goals (1–3 months)  

This makes the tool not just evaluative, but also **mentorship-oriented**.

---

### Step 8: Risk Prediction Module

The backend includes a lightweight **risk prediction engine** that flags potential issues such as:

- Missing tests  
- Poor documentation  
- High code complexity  
- Low commit activity  

Each risk is classified as low, medium, or high, and an overall risk score is computed. This helps recruiters quickly identify red flags.

---

### Step 9: REST API Design

The system exposes multiple REST APIs:

- `/api/analyze` → triggers full analysis  
- `/api/results` → returns score and evaluation  
- `/api/roadmap` → returns improvement plan  
- `/api/repo-details` → returns repository overview  
- `/api/risks` → returns risk analysis  

This clean API separation makes the backend scalable and frontend-friendly.

---

### Step 10: Execution and Deployment

Finally, the Flask server runs on port 5000. During development, debug mode is enabled for faster iteration. The architecture is deployment-ready and can easily be extended with databases, authentication, or caching.
